Details include:\r\nserver/instance name, catalog, db username, db password and the sql query itself.<br/>\r\n\r\nAfter hitting save the data is stored in the project's database (so it can be used later) and a url is given to the user.\r\nThis URL can be distributed and accessed directly. On the report page one finds basic report\r\nfunctionality like filter, pagination and sorting.\r\n\r\n# Current Limitations\r\nCurrently the data is being transferred as a whole to the browser, that means that if the query returns x number of rows\r\nall will be transferred to the clients browser and then cut off for pagination. This is because the current pagination works on the client side.\r\nAll data will be displayed in tabular format.\r\n\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add download to CSV</li>\r\n<li>Add API for automatic creation of reports</li>\r\n<li>Ability to display graphs</li>\r\n<li>Ability to display geographic maps</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
